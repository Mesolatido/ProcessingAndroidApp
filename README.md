# ProcessingAndroidApp
Repository for an app written using Processing for Android

## About Me
I program in both Java and Javascript, with some experience with Dot Net.

## Physics Assistant
I plan to make a physics app using Processing 3.1.1 (+libaries) to assist freshman engineering majors.

The code for it will be posted here.

##Long-term Goals for this project
It should eventually include the following elements:

► A generic guide to solving problems (ranging from simple to mildly complex)

◄ A light-weight 3D modeling system for mobile

► A small calculator supporting symbolic substitutions

◄ A discussion forum or link to an existing discussion forum 

##Process #1 Problem-Solution
►►Generic guide to solving problems◄◄

*_This is the writing portion of the program, all the guides will be drafted here_*

###Step 1: _What is your Problem?_
####Establish What The Problem Requires

Yes, you've seen this before. Chances are you've had the steps of the scientific method drilled into you long before this. Perhaps you've experienced engineering design in high school or on your own DIY project. But be warned before you skip this section... there are several distinguishing factors added to this part of the process, especially when you create your own designs. There will be a similar section on how to tackle physics and math problems to assist your projects.  

Try answering as many questions as possible in the following form:

*Need/Challenge*: 
What the need of person/group? Identify the problem concisely. 

Are you attempting to solve the correct problem?

What are the possible causes of the problem (list multiple)?


*List your Resources*:
What do you have available to you?

*Design constraints*: 
What is the Budget, if applicable? Are there Labor costs?

How much time do you have? Develop a timeline of events.
