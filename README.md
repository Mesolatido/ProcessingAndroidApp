# ProcessingAndroidApp
Repository for an app written using Processing for Android

## About Me
I program in both Java and Javascript, with some experience with Dot Net.

## Physics Assistant
I plan to make a physics app using Processing 3.1.1 (+libaries) to assist freshman engineering majors.

The code for it will be posted here.

##Long-term Goals for this project
It should eventually include the following elements:

► A generic guide to solving problems (ranging from simple to mildly complex)

◄ A light-weight 3D modeling system for mobile

► A small calculator supporting symbolic substitutions

◄ A discussion forum or link to an existing discussion forum
